**The Game**
  
The start screen allows a player to enter their name (no spaces, numbers or special chars.)  
Select single player. This will take you to the player select screen.  
Choose how many opponents you want to play against (1-9).  
Click Start.  
The game screen will appear with the human player's cards appearing face up in the bottom center left.  
The player may call, or fold the hand, or raise by entering the amount they wish and clicking the raise button.  
The game will continue until the player clicks the "exit" button, looses all their money or causes all the AI   
players to loose theirs.
